# Infrastructure Rules
Always Apply:
- Manage Docker Compose for frontend, backend, and database.
- Use `.env` files for environment variables.
- Keep services isolated but networked via docker-compose.

Auto-Attach:
- /docker/**
- /scripts/**
- /monorepo-config/**

Reference:
- /docker/docker-compose.yml
- /scripts/setup.sh

Monorepo:
- Use Yarn workspaces for package management.
- Maintain consistent linting and formatting across all packages.
