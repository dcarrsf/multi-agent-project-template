# Database Rules
Always Apply:
- Use MongoDB as the primary database.
- Use Mongoose as ORM
- All schema changes must include migrations.
- Normalize data for document storage where possible
- Implement a linter

Auto-Attach:
- /database/**
Reference:
- /database/migrations/
- /database/schema.sql

Docker:
- Ensure DB service in docker-compose uses persistent volumes.
